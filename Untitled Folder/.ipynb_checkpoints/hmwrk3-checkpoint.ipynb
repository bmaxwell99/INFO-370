This begs questions about consent as well as bias in the data about ethnic, gender and age misidentification. \n",

Although it's quite cold right now and the only people I can imagine being outside and wanting to sit/lay right now are houseless people and this data does not appear to have inquired about housing status. The documentation for the LivingActivities column states that houseless people can be \"recognized by the accompaniment of most of their personal belongings\" which is an understandable if suspect proxy for estimating their housing status. Is there double counting occuring between the Lying column and the LivingActivities column? Or does the observed get put into one or depending on the \"accompaniment of most of their personal belongings\"? Additionaly, the data about how people are physically occupying the space could therefore be used as an argument to develop \"defensive design\" seating/urban architecture. Defensive architecture can be employed as a morally suspect solution to houseless usage of public space and pretty inarguably as a haphazard bandaid for the social implications of houselessness. "

    "It's interesting to note that all surveys of people moving were done between about 8am and 7pm. Also interesting is that despite the mutually exclusive row data for gender and group size, the statistics are extremely similar. Maybe each surveyor counted both gender and group size but they were entered as different rows? This could be checked by comparing the statistics of Start_time for the rows with num_by_gender with the those of num_by_group."
